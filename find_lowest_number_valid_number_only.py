#START
# Initialize a variable to store the lowest number, set it to None
# Loop indefinitely:
  # Try:
    # Ask the user to enter a number
    # Convert input to an integer
    # If the lowest number is None or the new number is lower, update the lowest number
  # Except:
    # If the input is invalid, break the loop
# Display the lowest number entered
#END
